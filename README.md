scratch-mode
============

A very opinionated Emacs major mode for a multi-purpose
scratch buffer.

Provides hotkeys to access often used commands and to switch between
commonly "scratched" major modes.

Currently there are lots of implicit hopefully optional dependencies,
for example some keys open Notmuch or Deft.
